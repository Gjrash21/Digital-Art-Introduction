# Digital Art Techniques

Here are some popular techniques used in digital art:

### 1. Digital Painting
Digital painting mimics traditional painting but on a digital canvas.

### 2. Vector Art
Vector art uses paths rather than pixels, allowing images to be scaled without losing quality.

### 3. 3D Modeling
Artists use 3D software to create models for animations, games, and films.
